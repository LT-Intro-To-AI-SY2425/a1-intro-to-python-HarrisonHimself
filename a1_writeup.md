# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    I like the Python language alot more than Java, which I've learned before in APCSA. I think that it's alot less confusing (Not requiring semicolons), even though the general logic is similar. I like the system that requires you to have specific indentations, because I foud myself doing similar things for Java.



2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
    Again, I found it similar to Java. Java uses the same logic, from what I've seen, but just with different syntax. I liked that part because it felt familiar, but it felt like I had to remember less tedious syntax.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
    I learned how variables worked in Python, relearned how to iterate, and learned about asserts.
